# Gaia Renderer

# What is this?
- This is a Vulkan Renderer I'm working on mainly for learning Vulkan and how to implement more advanced graphical features.
- Currently, it's only the very basics; like the pipeline, vertex, staging and uniform buffers and image loading.

# Planned Features
This isn't in any specific order, just stuff I want to implement. I don't really have an exact timeframe for any of these features, but I hope to implement all of them!
